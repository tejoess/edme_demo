### Policy Data Flow & Category-Based Filtering

  PostgreSQL → FastAPI Backend → React Frontend

  All, Health, Travel, Auto, Home, Life
- Implemented frontend-only category-based filtering logic
- Added active category highlighting for better user clarity

user-selected categories, fulfilling the mentor’s requirement.
